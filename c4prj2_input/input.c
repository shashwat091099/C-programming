per line (and that we represent a hand with a deck_t). You should allocate a
deck_t for each hand and place it into an array of pointers to deck_ts, which is
your answer. This function needs to tell its caller how many hands it read. We
could return a struct, but we are going to do this a different way: it will fill
in *n_hands with the number of hands. This is a bit different, but you have seen
it before: this is how getline "returns" the string it read and the size of the
space allocated to that string.*/
